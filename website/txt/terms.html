<h2>WinderCAM: Terms and Conditions</h2>

<!-- promo
<h3>Subscription:</h3>
<p>The <strong>WinderCAM</strong> website is available for informational use without registration. However, in order to access the calculation functionality, you must be logged in and have an active subscription.</p>
<p>The price and duration of the subscription will be presented when initiating the payment process, before any payment is made or the subscription is activated.</p>
<p>Each subscription grants access to the calculation features within the limits of fair use. The maximum number of calculation function calls per subscription is limited to 10,000 for the entire paid subscription period. This limitation is intended to ensure the stable operation of the Service and to prevent abuse, including automated or bulk usage, as well as unauthorized resale of access. Exceeding this limit may result in a <strong>temporary suspension of access</strong> to calculation functions until the end of the current subscription period.
<br>If you require higher usage limits, please contact us to discuss custom subscription options.</p>
<p>Since access to the Service is granted immediately upon payment, you cannot cancel your subscription in accordance with applicable rules on digital goods and services.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> By default, your subscription will <strong>automatically renew for the same period</strong> at the end of each term, and the corresponding amount will be automatically charged to your account.</p>
<p>You may <strong>disable auto-renewal</strong> at any time by clicking the <strong>"Turn off auto-renewal"</strong> button in the <strong>"Account"</strong> menu in the <strong>"Subscription"</strong> section. Auto-renewal must be disabled before the end of the current subscription period to prevent renewal and further charges. If you cancel auto-renewal during the current subscription period, your existing subscription will remain active until the end of the paid period. Therefore, no refunds will be issued for the current subscription. <strong>WinderCAM</strong> reserves the right to disable automatic renewal at its sole discretion. In such case, the subscription will not be automatically renewed, and a new subscription will be required to continue using the Service.</p>
