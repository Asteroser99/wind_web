    <h2>Precise Calculation of Reinforcement Lines</h2>
    <p> The calculation of reinforcement lines starts with the calculation of the geodesic coil on the surface of rotation.<br />
        There are two initial parameters for this calculation - the radius of the pole hole and the width of the tape.<br />
        Having set these parameters to calculate the geodesic coil, click the button - <strong>Generate Coil</strong>.<br />
        You can see the result of the calculation on the mandrel surface.<br />
        The view of the result depends on the selected mode of displaying the keystrokes at the bottom of the screen.<br />
        The following modes of coil displaying are possible - line or tape.

    <h2>Generating Coil</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To calulate initial coil you must to select the initial value for the <strong>Pole radius ℝ</strong> (up to the edge of tape).</li>
        <li>Then you must set a tape width in input box <strong>Tape width<strong>.</strong></li>
        <li>To generate a geodesic coil you need to press the <strong>Generate Coil</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Results:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You will see the <strong>Coil</strong>on the surface of the mandrel in the form depending on pressing one of the three buttons:</li> <br />
        <li>   - First coil - only the first coil is shown;</li>
        <li>   - First round - N+1 turns are shown, where N is the <strong>Convenience</strong>;</li>
        <li>   - Full winding - shows the complete covering of the sheath with the tape.</li>
        <br />
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Semi-transparency or visibility of elements is controlled by the corresponding buttons at the bottom of the screen in the right part.</li>
        <li>The name of the button corresponds to the controlled element.</li>
        <li>   - Mandrel</li>
        <li>   - Lines</li>
        <li>   - Tape</li>
        <li>   - Equidistanta</li>
        <br />
    </ul>
