        <h2>Precise Calculation of Reinforcement Lines</h2>
        <p> ✦  Simplify the process of generating reinforcement lines with our advanced coil calculation methods.<br />
            ✦  You only need to define the pole hole radius and belt width to generate the initial geodesic coil line.<br />
            ✦  Our algorithms provide accurate calculation of the initial geodesic coil on any convex or convex-concave surface of rotation.<br />
            ✦  ( * but not every one of them can be implemented by filament winding... )
