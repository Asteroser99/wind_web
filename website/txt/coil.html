    <h2>Precise Calculation of Reinforcement Lines</h2>
    <p> ✦  The calculation of reinforcement lines starts with the calculation of the geodesic coil on the surface of rotation.<br />
        ✦  There are two initial parameters for this calculation - the radius of the pole hole and the width of the tape.<br />
        ✦  After specifying these parameters for the calculation of the geodesic coil, click the button - Coil calculation.<br />
        ✦  You can see the result of the calculation on the mandrel surface.<br />
        ✦  The view of the result depends on the selected mode of displaying the keystrokes at the bottom of the screen.<br />
        ✦  The following modes of coil displaying are possible - line or ribbon.

    <h2>Generating Coil</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pole ℝ</strong>: Select the initial value for the pole hole radius.(up to the edge of tape)</li>
        <li><strong>Band width</strong>: Select the value for the band width.</li>
        <li>Generate a geodesic coil by pressing the <strong>Generate Coil</strong> button.</li>
