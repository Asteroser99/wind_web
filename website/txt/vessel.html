        <h2>Integrated Workflow for Maximum Efficiency </h2>
        <p> ✦  Take advantage of our online solution, which integrates mandrel profile preparation, reinforcement tape positioning, winder movements and CNC programming into a single workflow.<br /> 
            ✦  By integrating every step of the process, we help you reduce errors, save time and achieve high product quality, making it the ideal choice for industries that demand speed, accuracy and efficiency.<br />
            ✦  Our pilot project is currently enabling us to perform all the basic steps of filament winding preparation on a four-axis machine with a conoidal roller output.<br /> 
            ✦  Kinematic postprocessors are being prepared for three-axis machines with self-aligning comb or output arc, for five-axis winding machines as well as for robotic winding systems.
