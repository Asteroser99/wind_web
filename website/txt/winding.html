    <h2>Visual Simulation of Machine Operation and CNC Program Generation</h2>
    <p> ✦  See in detail how the winding machine executes the calculated program of controlled coordinate motion.<br />
        ✦  Automate your pre-production workflow with our NC program generation function.<br />
        ✦  Based on the calculated motion paths, the system generates basic NC code that is compatible with a wide range of machine tools.<br />
        ✦  Reduce setup time and achieve precise results with minimal manual adjustments.<br />
        ✦  Bring your CNC to the shop floor - to the machine!<br />
        ✦  ( The CNC program format for the specific brand of CNC rack needs to be specified ).
