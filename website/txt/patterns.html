    <p class="big"> On this page, you can explore different ways to adjust the coil winding pattern to ensure better continuity of the shell. </p>

    <h2>Correction Variants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Choose the desired <strong>Convenience</strong> value — this defines the number of wedges in the winding
            and is a key parameter influencing the coil pattern and the interlacing of layers. For certain Convenience
            values, multiple correction options are available within specific limits. </li>
        <li> Enable the <strong>Mesh structure</strong> option if you want to generate a mesh-style winding pattern.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p> The system solves an integer Diophantine equation to generate a table of valid correction variants. These
        variants ensure smooth transitions between layers and overall shell continuity. </p>

    <h2>Applying Coil Correction</h2>
    <p> From the table, select a coil correction variant that suits your needs. </p>
    <p> Pay attention to the correction percentage of the coil period — the lower it is compared to the ideal geodesic
        value, the better the continuity of the final shell. </p>
    <p> A diagram will display the stacking order of the tape for the selected variant. </p>
    <p> Click the <strong>Correct coil</strong> button to apply the selected period correction. </p>

    <p class="big"> The original geodesic coil is gradually transformed into a corrected non-geodesic coil, with varying degrees of deviation to ensure optimal shell structure. </p>
