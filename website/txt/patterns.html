    <h2>Coil Correction to Ensure Shell Continuity</h2>
    <p> ✦  As a result of solving the integer Diophantine equation, we obtain the variants of geodesic coil correction that ensure the shell continuity.<br />
        ✦  The geodesic coil is uniformly transformed into a non-geodesic coil with different degrees of deviation from the steady state.<br /> 
        ✦  It is recommended to choose the variant with minimum deviation in percentage.<br /> 
        ✦  The key parameter is the heading, which determines the coil pattern and to some extent the degree of interlacing of the layers.<br />
        ✦  There are not suitable options for every infeed value to limit the correction of the coil period within the specified limits.
