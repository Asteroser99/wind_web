    <h2>Coil Correction to Ensure Shell Continuity</h2>
    <p>As a result of solving the integer Diophant equation, we obtain a table of variants of geodesic coil correction to ensure the continuity of the shell.<br />
       The geodesic coil is uniformly transformed into a non-geodesic coil with different degrees of deviation.<br /> 
       It is recommended to choose the option with the lowest percentage deviation.<br /> 
       The key parameter is the Convenience, which determines the coil pattern and the degree of interlacing of the layers.<br />
       For some (not for all) Convenience values there are a set of options with period correction within specified limits.<br />
       Choose the Convenience value and the coil correction option from the table that suits you.<br />
       In the diagram you can observe the order of tape stacking corresponding to the selected variant.<br />
       Using the buttons at the bottom of the screen you can set the mode of displaying a single coil, N+1 coils or continuous shell coverage, where N is Convenience. <br />

    <h2>Coil Correction</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Select the desired <strong>Convenience</strong> Number of wedges in the winding pattern.</li>
        <li>Hit the <strong>Mesh structure</strong> flag if you want to create a mesh structure.</li>
        <li>Select the ribbon laying variant in the layer from the table, 
            &#9; &#9; &#9; &#9;    focusing on the minimum percentage of correction of the coil period, compared to the geodetic one.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong> Correct coil</strong> button to correct the coil period.</li>
        <li>Using the buttons at the bottom of the screen you can set the mode of displaying coils.</li>
