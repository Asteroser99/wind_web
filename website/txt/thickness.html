        This operation generates essential data for strength analysis and quality evaluation of the final product. 
        The accuracy of these calculations is critical, as they directly affect the reliability of simulation results.
        Special attention is given to ensuring that the mathematical model is adequate, especially near known singularities such as the pole hole.
