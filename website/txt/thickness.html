    <h2>Layers Thickness Calculation</h2>
    <p> ✦  This final operation generates data for transmission to the unit for analyzing the strength characteristics of the finished product and evaluating product quality.<br />
        ✦  This fact determines the importance of accuracy of calculations at this stage and requires special attention to the adequacy of mathematical models to eliminate the known singularity at the pole hole.<br />
        ✦  At the moment, a rather established algorithm for thickness calculation is used, but the research continues and approximation algorithms based on physically adequate approaches to this problem will be applied.<br />
        ✦  The data sets obtained at this stage will be harmonized in format as input data for FEM programs such as Abaqus, Ansys or Femap.
