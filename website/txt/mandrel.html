        <h2>Preparing your mandrels for calculation</h2>
        <p>✦  Our platform allows you to use some tools to prepare your mandrel profiles in advance.<br />
           ✦  A mandrel is described by a set of points whose coordinates r = r(x) are listed in two columns,<br />
              and the position of column r can be specified in the dialog, so you can use any of your csv files for import.<br />
           ✦  Import your file with a full or half profile of the mandrel and transform it to get a complete profile ready for further calculations.</p>
